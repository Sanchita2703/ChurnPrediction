# ðŸš€ Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning Internship Project

This project is part of my Machine Learning internship, where I worked on a binary classification problem using the Telco Customer Churn Dataset. The goal was to build a predictive model that identifies whether a customer is likely to churn based on their service details and demographic data.

## ðŸ”§ Project Tasks

### âœ… Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Handled missing values (notably in the `TotalCharges` column)
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler

### âœ… Data Splitting
- Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets using `train_test_split`

### âœ… Model Training
- Trained two classifiers:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - **Logistic Regression**

### âœ… Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the performance of the models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - ROC-AUC Score
